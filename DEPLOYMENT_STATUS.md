# Deployment Status

## Latest Update: September 27, 2025 - ï¿½ FIXED SECRET REFERENCE ERROR

âœ… **Root vercel.json DELETED** - No more schema conflicts
âœ… **Correct vercel.json active** - Located in ai-task-manager/
âœ… **GitHub integration ready** - All changes pushed
âœ… **SECRET REFERENCE FIXED** - Removed @gemini_api_key from vercel.json
ðŸ”„ **Triggering deployment without secret reference**

## Configuration Summary

- **Root Directory**: `ai-task-manager`
- **Frontend Build**: `@vercel/static-build` from `frontend/package.json`
- **Backend API**: `@vercel/python` from `backend/main.py`
- **Routes**: `/api/*` â†’ backend, `/*` â†’ frontend
- **Environment**: Configure GEMINI_API_KEY directly in Vercel Dashboard (not as secret)

## What Was Fixed

- Removed `"env": { "GEMINI_API_KEY": "@gemini_api_key" }` from vercel.json
- Environment variables should be set in Vercel Dashboard, not referenced in config

## Next Steps

1. This deployment should succeed without secret reference error
2. Add GEMINI_API_KEY as regular environment variable in Vercel Dashboard
3. Backend will access it via standard environment variables

This file was updated to trigger deployment after fixing secret reference - attempt #3.
